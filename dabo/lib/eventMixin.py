		To use this feature, just define a method on<EventName>(), or	if you
		want a parent container to respond to the event, make a method in the
		parent on<EventName>_<object Name or RegID>().

			class MyButton(dabo.ui.dButton):

			class MyPanel(dabo.ui.dPanel):
				def afterInit(self):
					self.addObject(MyButton, RegID="btn1")

				def onHit_btn1(self, evt):
					print "panel: button hit!"

		When the button is pressed, you'll see both 'hit' messages because of
		auto event binding.

		If you want to bind your events explicitly, you can turn off auto event
		binding by issuing::

			 dabo.autoBindEvents = False
