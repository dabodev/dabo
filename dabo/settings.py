Dabo Global Settings

Do not modify this file directly. Instead, create a file called
settings_override.py, and copy/paste the settings section below into the
settings_override.py file. This way, when you update Dabo, you won't blow
away your custom tweaks.

Note that creating a settings_override.py isn't the only way to tweak the
settings - your custom code can also just make the settings in the dabo
namespace at runtime, eg::

	import dabo
	dabo.eventLogging = True
	<do stuff>
	dabo.eventLogging = False

.. note::

	settings_override.py is not the appropriate place to put
	application-specific settings, although it may seem at first like an easy
	place to do so.

### Settings - begin

# Event logging is turned off globally by default for performance reasons.
# Set to True (and also set LogEvents on the object(s)) to get logging.
eventLogging = False

# Set the following to True to get all the data in the UI event put into
# the dEvent EventData dictionary. Only do that for testing, though,
# because it is very expensive from a performance standpoint.
allNativeEventInfo = False

# Set fastNameSet to True to bypass Dabo's checking to make sure siblings
# have unique names, greatly speeding up instantiation of many objects. If you
# do this, your code takes responsibility for ensuring that sibling names are
# in fact unique. We recommend you leave fastNameSet to False here, and wrap
# your object creations around setting it to True. eg:
#
#   dabo.fastNameSet = True
#   for i in range(200):
#     self.addObject(dabo.ui.dButton, Name="b_%s" % i)
#   dabo.fastNameSet = False
fastNameSet = False

# autoBindEvents specifies whether events are bound
# automatically to callback functions when the object is instantiated. E.g.,
# where you used to have to have code like:
#
#   def initEvents(self):
#       self.bindEvent(dEvents.MouseEnter, self.onMouseEnter)
#
# with autoBindEvents, all you need to do is define the onMouseEnter function,
# and Dabo will understand that that function should be called upon the
# MouseEnter event. Additionally, if an object has it's RegID set, the form
# can have callbacks of the form on<EventName>_<ObjectName>(), which become
# the callback function for that event and object. E.g.:
#
#   def onMouseEnter_cmdOkay(self, evt):
#       """This gets called when the mouse enters the okay command button."""
#
autoBindEvents = True

# If you set MDI to True, then dFormMain and dForm will default to being MDI
# parent and MDI child, respectively. IOW, you don't have to change your dForm
# and dFormMain subclasses to inherit from dFormChildMDI, etc., but it comes at
# the cost of being a global setting. This must be set before dabo.ui is
# imported (ie right at the top of your app). Note that you could instead choose
# to deal with MDI/SDI explicitly in your form subclasses. IOW:
#		class MyForm(dabo.ui.dFormChildMDI)
#		class MyForm(dabo.ui.dFormParentMDI)
#		class MyForm(dabo.ui.dFormSDI)
#
# All the MDI setting does is make dFormMain == (dFormMainSDI or dFormMainParentMDI)
# and dForm == (dFormSDI or dFormChildMDI)
#
# Setting MDI to True on Mac is essential to get a native-feeling Mac app
# where closing the last form doesn't exit the app. Whatever form has the
# focus will determine the menu used - the ParentMDI form is never shown on
# Mac but it's menu will be displayed on the Mac system menu bar.
#
# Setting MDI to True on Windows is still what users expect for most apps.
#
# Setting MDI to True on Linux results in a pageframe setup with each child
# form being a page in the parent pageframe.
MDI = False

# macFontScaling: If you set a font to 10 pt it'll look medium-small on most
# Windows and Linux screens. However, it will look very small on Mac because
# of automatic conversion in OS X. 8pt fonts on Mac are barely even readable.
# Set macFontScaling to True to make your fonts appear the same size on all
# platforms.
macFontScaling = True

# When doing date calculations, displaying calendars, etc., this determines whether
# 'Sunday' or 'Monday' is considered the beginning of the week

# If you notice that events don't seem to be happening correctly,
# change this to False to see if that improves things. If so, please
# report it the Dabo developers.

# Does the UI layer (dForm) eat exceptions from the biz layer

# quickly diagnose the issue (False)?
eatBizExceptions = True

# Check for web updates?
checkForWebUpdates = True

# your code can easily override these. Example:
#   dabo.dateFormat = "%d.%m.%Y" -> "31.12.2008".

# the extension as the key, and the descriptive text as the value. To add your own
# custom extensions, create a dict with this same format named 'custom_extensions'
# in your settings_override file, and those will be added to this list.
