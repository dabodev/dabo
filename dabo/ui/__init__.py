This is Dabo's user interface layer which is the topmost layer.

There are submodules for all supported UI libraries. As of this writing,
the only supported UI library is wxPython (uiwx).

To use a given submodule at runtime, you need to call loadUI() with the
ui module you want as a parameter. For instance, to load wxPython, you
would issue::

	import dabo.ui
	dabo.ui.loadUI("wx")

def makeProxyProperty(dct, nm, proxyAtts):

	When creating composite controls, it is necessary to be able to pass through
	property get/set calls to an object or objects within the composite control. For
	example, if a class based on dPanel contains a textbox and a label, I might want
	to proxy the class's Caption to the label's Caption, the Value to the textbox, and
	the FontSize to both. In order to do this, the object(s) to be proxied must be
	stored in the custom class as references in attributes of the custom class, and
	passed in the 'proxyAtts' parameter. In addition, passing 'self' as one of the
	proxyAtts will apply the property to the custom class itself; a good example
	would be a property like 'Height': the outer panel needs to grow as well as the
	inner controls. In this case, assuming you store a reference to the textbox and
	label in attributes named '_textbox' and '_label', respectively, the code in your
	custom composite class would look like::

		_proxyDict = {}
		Caption = makeProxyProperty(_proxyDict, "Caption", "_label")
		FontSize = makeProxyProperty(_proxyDict, "FontSize", ("_textbox", "_label"))
		Height = makeProxyProperty(_proxyDict, "Value", ("self", "_textbox"))
		Value = makeProxyProperty(_proxyDict, "Value", "_textbox")

	For setter operations, if the 'proxyAtts' is a sequence of more than one object, the
	setting will be applied to all. For the getter, only the first object in the sequence
	with that property will be used.

	You must declare an attribute named '_proxyDict' in the class definition before you
	call this method; '_proxyDict' should be an empty dictionary. This dict needs to be
	passed to this method, since there is no 'self' reference at the time that properties
	are declared in a class definition.

	'nm' is the name of the property to be proxied. 'proxyAtts' is either a single string
	with the name of the attribute that will hold the reference to the inner control, or
	it should be a tuple of strings, each of which is the name of an attribute that contains
	the reference to an inner control.
