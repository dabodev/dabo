<h3>About Minesweeper</h3>
<p> <b>Minesweeper</b> is a classic computer game, implemented here in the Dabo UI. </p>

<h3>Object of the Game</h3>
<p> To identify all the mines without getting yourself blown up. </p>

<h3>Starting a Game</h3>
<p> Click the 'New' button in the toolbar at the top of the form. </p>

<h3>Playing the Game</h3>
<p> Click any square. If it is a mine, you are dead, and the game is over. If it is not a mine,
the number of mines on the squares immediately adjacent to that square will be displayed. Use
those numbers to judge the likelihood that mines will be located nearby. </p>

<p> Right-clicking on a square cycles it between three states: Marked (i.e., identified as a mine),
Uncertain (might be a mine; be careful about clicking!), or Normal. </p>

<h3>Winning the Game</h3>
<p> When you have correctly identified all the mines without getting yourself blown up. </p>
